			"Discord Free Nitro - Free Discord Nitro 2021" is a theme for Chromium (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera) browsers which appears to exist for the primary purpose of promoting a scam website which claims to give you Discord Nitro.
While the theme does not seem harmful, you still may want to remove it.
<h4>How to remove it from Google Chrome</h4>To remove this from Google Chrome, go to chrome://settings. In the sidebar, click Appearance.
At the top, it should say Theme. Click the "Reset to default" button next to that.
Your browser should now be running the default theme.
<h4>How to remove it from Microsoft Edge:</h4>To remove this theme from Microsoft Edge (and reset back the the default theme, where you can select a theme of your choice), go to edge://settings, click Appearance, and then click 'Default' under Theme.
<h4>Remove this from Brave</h4>Open Brave and go to brave://settings
Click on Appearance
Next to 'Theme' there should be a 'Reset to default' button. Click that and Brave's theme should have been reset 

How did this get on my computer?
This theme is normally installed from the Chrome Web Store.
