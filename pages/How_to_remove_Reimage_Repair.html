			Reimage Repair is a shady piece of software which claims to fix issues with your Windows computer. The company behind it uses scam-like tactics to promote their product, and after installed, it will try to convince you to buy it by showing fake issues with your computer.<br><img width='850' src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84232764/157139690-c2d0a340-ba66-4d72-8299-926c02b4d06d.png" alt='Reimage shows issues with a prefectly safe Windows 11 machine' title='Reimage shows issues with a prefectly safe Windows 11 machine'><br>I recommend people avoid installing Reimage.
