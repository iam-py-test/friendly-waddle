			Reimage Repair is a shady piece of software which claims to fix issues with your Windows computer. The company behind it uses scam-like tactics to promote their product, and after installed, it will try to convince you to buy it by showing fake issues with your computer.<br><img width='850' src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84232764/157139690-c2d0a340-ba66-4d72-8299-926c02b4d06d.png" alt='Reimage shows issues with a prefectly safe Windows 11 machine' title='Reimage shows issues with a prefectly safe Windows 11 machine'><br>I recommend people avoid installing Reimage. If you or someone you know has it installed, I will show how to remove it.<br>Before removing Reimage, save all of your work and close all applications. Be sure you close all Reimage windows as well (if they don't close, try rebooting).<br>First, let's try to uninstall Reimage using the Windows settings. <br>
If you are using Windows 10, follow the instructions at <a href='https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uninstall-or-remove-apps-and-programs-in-windows-10-4b55f974-2cc6-2d2b-d092-5905080eaf98'>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uninstall-or-remove-apps-and-programs-in-windows-10-4b55f974-2cc6-2d2b-d092-5905080eaf98</a>.<br> If you are using Windows 11, use this guide: <a href='https://www.howtogeek.com/749585/how-to-uninstall-an-application-on-windows-11/'>https://www.howtogeek.com/749585/how-to-uninstall-an-application-on-windows-11/</a>.<br> If you use another version of Windows, then you may need find instructions for that specific version.<br>
