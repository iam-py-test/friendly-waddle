    "body":"Python-in-browser is a project I have been working on which allows you to run Python code in your browser, sandboxed away from your system.\n \nI was inspired by https://github.com/raxod502/python-in-a-box, but python-in-browser has very few things in common. \nPython-in-a-box runs Python code on a server, so it has access to most of the good Python featues.\nPython-in-browser parses Python code in your browser, so it lacks most of those features. \nThe only good thing about Python-in-browser is the fact that it sends no requests to a server, so it works offline. (to some degree, and the page must be loaded with an internet connection)\nPython-in-browser can be found at https://iam-py-test.github.io/python-in-browser, and the source code is at https://github.com/iam-py-test/python-in-browser"

NoScript also provides protection against XSS (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/xss), but I have never seen it block a real attack. \nHowever, its XSS protection was able to block all of the XSS tests I knew and all of the OWASP advanced ones I tested.

I clicked on the 9th result, and immediately it was blocked by the Blocklist Project malware (found here - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blocklistproject/Lists/master/malware.txt) due to its root domain.\nVirusTotal shows three detections for it, but the root domain had 4 and a poor community rating. A comment from 5 years ago says \"It's just a breeding ground for viruses! \".\nNorton's community reports are all from 9 or more years ago, and is rated poorly.\nFinally, MyWOT has one community rating from 6 years ago that marks it as low trust, and the icon at the top is orange.\n"
