(to some degree, and the page must be loaded with an internet connection)\nPython-in-browser can be found at https://iam-py-test.github.io/python-in-browser, and the source code is at https://github.com/iam-py-test/python-in-browser"

    "title":"Don't enable Macros; they can infect your computer",
    "body":"Microsoft Office macros are being abused to infect peoples computers with malware; the Dridex malware is spread primarly throught this, and this attack has been used many other times. Not all Macros are bad; many people use Macros for legit uses, and this makes fighting Macro viruses even harder.\nPlus, Macro viruses are hard to detect by antivirus scanners (1), and manual analysis is not a viable option.\nThe real responsibility for preventing this type of malware falls to Microsoft, who (as of May 17th) has failed to patch this. \nTo my knowlage, this exploit only effects Windows.\n\nWhat can you do about this:\n1. Do not open attachments from strange emails\n2. Do not enable Macros in emails or from other devices\nWhile you may think it is ok to run Macros from a trusted source, they could be infected (some people have been infected via emails from trusted sources) or the address could have been spoofed.\n3. Install an antivirus (even on MacOS)\nWhile antivirus software is not perfect, it can stop malware infections. I recommend https://malwarebytes.com, but any good antivirus should do. \nHowever, make sure your antivirus uses heuristics. Personally, I recommend against using McAfee.\n4. Keep your system and all software up-to-date\nThis is important, as security patches and antivirus updates can eliminate malware.\nNormally new Macro virus are detected soon, as the malware reported to https://www.joesandbox.com/analysis/413824/0/html now has 35 detections (https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/692868392ecf930f456d9387ee6132eac61cc07913e668fe6af575f16fbb2392/detection)\n5. Don't use Windows\nThis exploit, and a lot of other malware, primarly or only attacks Windows. Even if you are using a secure OS, you still should follow the above steps.\n6. If you think you have been infected, immediately disconnect from the internet and (if possible) manually disable the router. \nThen run an antimalware scan on your device and all devices on that network. \nIf you think you were infected by an email from someone you trust, tell them to scan their system for malware.\nOn Windows, I recommend you scan using your antivirus and Windows Defender (full and offline scans). \nAlso download (via another computer if possible) Malwarebytes free (here - https://www.malwarebytes.com/), ADWCleaner (here - https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner), Malwarebytes antirootkit (beta) (here - https://www.malwarebytes.com/antirootkit), and Hitman Pro (here - https://secure2.sophos.com/en-us/products/free-tools/hitmanpro.aspx).\nLinks to more information:\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/hundreds-of-urls-inside-microsoft-excel-spreads-new-dridex-trojan-variant \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_virus\nhttps://iam-py-test.github.io/security_research/reports.html#report-Exploit:Win64/msoffice.malwaredownload\n"

    "title":"Testing McAfee WebAdvisor, Norton LifeLock, and FortiGuard against malware",
    "body":"McAfee WebAdvisor, Norton LifeLock, and FortiGuard all have malware website detection systems, so I decided to test them out against a bunch of malware domains to figure out which is best.\nI am getting these domains from URLHaus and from my personal antimalware filter. I will put the links at the end of this post.\n\nI will be testing 10 domains from each, starting at the top.\n\nOur first domain gets a Malware rating from McAfee and FortiGuard, and Caution rating from Nortron.\n\nNumber 7 was our first miss; FortiGuard failed to detect it, while Norton and McAfee detected it as Caution.\n\nThe first part showed that Norton rated all but one as Caution, and McAfee rated 4 as caution. FortiGuard was the only one to have a miss.On to the second test. \n\nOur first domain from my list is a miss for all. However, the first domain was a domain which had fallen into malware hands and used to be ok. \nConsitering FortiGuard's rating was from 2010 and the Norton community reports (all good) are from 10-11 years ago, these reports are just outdated. Still not great.\n\nThe next domain, however, was 2/3 with FortiGuard marking as Domain Parking, and the next was back to all avs. \n\nNumbers 4 & 5 are dead domaisn, so I am skiping them\n\n 6 was a flop, with all avs detecting it as safe. Note that 6 is a well known - and still online - scam domain.\n\n7 was missed by Norton, which is weird consitering the 7 av detections on VirusTotal and domain-level block by uBlock Origin.\n\nI am skiping to number 11 becuase it is more interesting.\nAll detect it, and Norton has one community report. Not supprising though. The weird part is that McAfee claims the domain is parked (it is not) but detects it anyway.\n12 is a major phishing domain, but still gets caution from Norton. I wonder what Caution really means...\n13 is weird; Norton gives it a big red DANGER, but FortiGuard and McAfee don't. To make things weirder, FortiGuard's detection log shows it should be detected, but it is not.\nAt the end, out of 20, McAfee detected 17, FortiGuard detected 15, and Norton detected 17. This leaves Norton and McAfee tied, and FortiGuard left behind. \nOver all, that is not what I expected. I expected Norton and FortiGuard to be at the top, and McAfee to have more misses. \n \nDue to the low sample size, I am going to test 6 more domains from The BlockList Project's ransomware domains list.\nResults: McAfee and Norton detected everything, and FortiGuard only detected two. This is very intresting; these domains are not just your garden variety malware; all of these domain are known ransomware. These stats show that FortiGuard has poorer detection then Norton and McAfee.\nLater, I plan on automatting the test and testing far more domains, as to get a better look at what these AVs detect and miss. I also may test domains against other tools.\n Till then, stay safe!\n\n\nLinks:\nFortiGuard: https://www.fortiguard.com/webfilter?q=example.com&version=8\nMcAfee (will need to type the domain into the url bar): https://www.siteadvisor.com/sitereport.html?url=example.com\nNorton: https://safeweb.norton.com/report/show?url=example.com\n\nTest lists:\nURLHaus: https://curben.gitlab.io/malware-filter/urlhaus-filter-online.txt\nMy list: https://github.com/iam-py-test/my_filters_001/blob/main/Alternative%20list%20formats/antimalware_domains.txt\nBlock List Project ransomware: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blocklistproject/Lists/master/ransomware.txt "

On to the phishing filter...\nOn the phishing filter, number 2 was detected, as well as three. Number 5 has a warning, stating that some pages are harmful. Numbers 9 and 10 were detected, but 8 was not.\nJust for reference, I tested numbers 8,9, 10, and 11 against McAfee, and it detected all of them. \n\nTotal Detected: 5/22\n\nThese detections show that Google Safe Browsing can detect some domains, but that on its own, it is not sufficent protection.\nAlso consitering it is the default in many browsers, by the time a site is detected by it, it has pretty much met its end.\n\nStay safe everyone!"
